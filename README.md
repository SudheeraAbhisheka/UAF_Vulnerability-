# UAF_Vulnerability-

First turn off randomisation

Then move inside gdb and type "info functions". This allows to us to obtain all the functions in the binary.

Next run inside gdb and type "info address exploit". We can obtain the memory address of the exploit function this way.

Copy the address of the exploit function and quit the debugger.

Write a python script to insert the memory address of the exploit function to a text file.

Execute the binary providing above created text file.
